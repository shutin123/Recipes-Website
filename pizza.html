        <h1>PIZZA</h1>
        <img src="pizza.jpeg" alt="odin-recipes">
        <p1>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened
              wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients 
              (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, 
              etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
              A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
             A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p1>
